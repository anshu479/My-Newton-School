<h1> Photo Phactory </h1>
<h2> Description- </h2>
<p> Photo Phactory as the name depicts, is a photography website showcasing the collection of photos clicked by me at different locations. It have a detailed description of photos at different locations and with different cameras. Challenging part was where i had to set up the images as per the size of the page and tried to make sure none of the images cover any content or goes out of the page. In future i will be makeing my website more responsive and use of java script for enabling user to interact with it. </p>
